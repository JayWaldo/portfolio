# My personal portfolio

This is my personal website where I'm going to update my projects, mini apps, contact and more stuff I'd consider nice to put

I will deploy it in a server later but, may be, this will going on github pages first, until I add the backend and stuf.

## Sections
At first, there'll be a few basic section, like:
  -Home
    Where a simple introduction is going to be displayed
  -About
    Here's where the main info will appear
  -Projects
    I'm thinking on display mini apps here so the user can play with them
  -Skills
    Here I will show the technologies I work with, and softskills
  -Certifications
    I'm thinking on show all the certifications, scholar path and so on
  -Contact
    Here is where I'll display the info to contact me or a friendly form to reache them out
